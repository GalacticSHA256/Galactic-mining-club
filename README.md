Long Term Vision- Galactic Mining Club aims to become the leader in NFT technologies. Pushing the limits of what is possible and raising the bar for what future NFTs bring to the ecosystem. We provide long term sustainable APYs by bridging real world money producing assets to the blockchain. All powered with the most efficient green technology Introduction. By limiting the total supply of our NFTs to 5000 we give holders a reason to hold long term, as the club expands operations APYs will steadily grow with the project. APYs will NEVER be diminished due to accommodate for new holders. 

Cryptocurrency mining is the competitive process that verifies and adds new transactions to the blockchain for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work (PoW) method. The miner that is selected is rewarded with some amount of the currency and/or transaction fees. Currently, there is a stigma that cryptocurrency mining is harmful to the environment due to its high energy requirement and powerful computers needed to process transactions. 

Staking The Galactic Mining Club Will use funds from our NFT sale to expand our mining operations to create a constant flow of liquidity into the ecosystem. NFT holders will be able to stake NFTs and receive a sustainable yet varying APY rate that will be based on mining algorithms that’s automatically adjust to market conditions. This helps prevent big drops in the value of staking APYs. 

Ex. When the price of bitcoin drops dramatically mining algorithms lower the difficulty level of mining allowing more Satoshis to be rewarded for successful blocks. 

Mining difficulty adjustments are made by comparing the standard time it should take to find 2,016 blocks of transactions on the Bitcoin network to the time it took to find the last 2,016 blocks. Keep in mind that the accepted block time is 10 minutes. Therefore, the expected time for mining 2016 blocks is 20,160 minutes (that is, 2016 X 10 minutes). The network calculates the total time it takes to mine the last 2,016 blocks. The ratio of the standard 20,160 minutes (10 minutes x 2,016 blocks) to the time it took to scale the last difficulty epoch is then multiplied by the most recent difficulty level. The calculation yields a result that will determine the required percentage change in the mining difficulty that will bring the block time to the desired 10 minutes. While a 10-minute block time is the goal, the mining difficulty cannot be altered above or below four times the current difficulty level. The upper limit for each difficulty epoch is a +300% change, while the lower is a -75% alteration. This rule is put in place to eliminate any abrupt changes in mining difficulty 

Our staking APYs will closely follow the rate of mining rewards ensuring as long as the underlying token is being used or traded, we will produce a reliable source of income for staking APYs. Diversifying our mining nodes and creating validator nodes on POS ecosystems further will help create more reliable and sustainable sources for staking. 

 

NFT holders will be able to visit the official Galactic Mining website to view their estimated rewards for staking NFTs. The club's website will also provide other information such as the facility hash rate, all ecosystems we validate blocks for, energy usage and savings from green technology.  

Road map of future utilities 

Mining and staking NFTs is only the tip of the iceberg. As the club's treasury grows, we will begin to implement completely new defi opportunities. Since our NFTs represent a synthetic version of real-world assets that work and produce an income 24/7. The   Mining club will be able to accept NFTs as collateral for small self-paying loans to our holders. 

NFT Collateralized Loans- 

Your Galactic Mining NFT can also be used as an investment tool. When you stake your NFT you will have an option to take out a collateralized loan on your NFTs future yield. The club will charge a 4% fee for borrowed assets. Earned staking APY will automatically pay down loans for borrowers. Borrowers can also add assets to manually pay down loans. Borrowers can borrow up to 60% of the value of their deposited value. Liquidations will commence at a 90% TVL. Where deposited assets will become part of the club's treasury. 

 

Fractionalized NFTS- NFT floor price will most likely be represented by future yield. As the APY’s and utilities grow with project we expect our NFTs to greatly rise in price. This will give whales an unfair advantage over the average investor. To keep the floor prices fair for all investors the club will introduce fractionalized NFTs. This process will allow smaller investor to purchase a fraction of a NFT now with the ability to make payments overtime until the full cost of the NFT is covered. No utilities will be available until the entire cost is covered. Staking rewards will instead be deposited into the Clubs treasury. 

 

Solo mining- Users with a higher risk tolerance swill have options to stake NFT’s in the Galactic Mining Clubs own pool. Usually, solo mining involves one person attempting to validate an entire block by themselves. This is called solo mining, and allows miners to claim an entire block reward for themself instead of splitting it with thousands of other miners. Why don’t all miners solo mine if the rewards are better? Usually block rewards go to miners who can validate blocks the quickest. Pool mining combines hash power of thousands of miners increasing Hash power speed and provides a steady rate of return but you receive less rewards for validated blocks as rewards are split with all miner in the pool. 

 

Swap Dex- 
As we bring more nonnative assets to the ecosystem, users will need a quick and easy place to swap nonnative assets for native assets. The Galactic swap will make this possible. Trade bitcoin for JUNO or KDA for OSMO easily all in one place. 

Liquidity pools- 

As the project grows and creates a diverse portfolio of assets for the treasury and its users the Galactic Mining Club will open up the Galactic farm where users can easily swap tokens or provide liquidity for multiple assets held by the club. All swapping fees will be used to reward liquidity providers creating a low yet sustainable APY. 

All assets bought by the Galactic Mining Club will be 100% owned by the NFT holders. All rights to any miners purchased by the club belong to the NFT holders. If a holder chooses to sell their NFT, they sell their right to vote in the Galactic Mining Club addition to any other benefits that NFT comes with. NFT holders who provide liquidity will receive a larger percentage of trading fee or a boosted APY. The Galactic Mining Club may choose to incentivize certain pools with better APYs by writing and submitting a proposal that can be voted on by anyone hold a club NFT. Incentives may come from any other service that produces revenue for the project such as mining and borrowing fees from collateralized loans. Time frames may vary depending on the proposal and will be totally up to the proposal writer and community voting. Any incentives found to be harmful, unfair, or not beneficial to broader Community may be reversed.
